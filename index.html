    I'm Jonathan. A programming aspirant, a dilligent member of my church, and an enjoyer of a variety of nerdy hobbies.
    <br>

    I was born in Oregon and have lived here since.

    How I got into programming:<br>
    My introduction to programming was in college. I took it at the community college level, and eventually moved on to the university level.<br>

    Ultimately a leg injury coinciding with things going back to in person had me leave the scene for the time.<br>
    <!-- Something like a bad case of sciatica. Went to the doctors. The certainty at the cause dwindled as time went on, but yeah, something along the lines of sciatica. -->

    Now with coding temple I'm re-entering the programmer path.<br>
